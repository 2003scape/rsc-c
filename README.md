## build (linux)

install [libsdl2-dev](https://packages.debian.org/sid/libsdl2-dev).
if compiling with opengl support, also install
[libsdl2-image-dev](https://packages.debian.org/sid/libsdl2-image-dev),
[libglew-dev](https://packages.debian.org/sid/libglew-dev),
[libgl-dev](https://packages.debian.org/sid/libgl-dev),
and [pkgconf](https://packages.debian.org/sid/pkgconf).

    $ make
    $ ./mudclient

distribute with `./cache` directory.

## build (windows)

install [mingw-w64](https://packages.debian.org/sid/mingw-w64).

use [wine](https://packages.debian.org/sid/wine) to test locally.

    $ make -f Makefile.windows
    $ wine mudclient.exe

distribute with `./SDL2.dll`, `./glew32.dll` and `./cache` directory.

## build (windows 9x)

building requires at least 256MB of ram and a pentium pro or greater processor

download [gcc-win98](https://github.com/fsb4000/gcc-for-Windows98/releases).

download [mingw](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MinGW/Extension/make/mingw32-make-3.80-3/).

### setup

extract gcc win98 to C:\gcc_win98

install mingw to C:\mingw

inside C:\mingw\bin copy the mingw32-make.exe as make.exe

edit autoexec.bat on drive C and add
```
PATH=C:\mingw\bin
```

then run the following in a command window

```
make -f Makefile.win9x
```

distribute with `./SDL.dll`, `./SDL_image.dll`, and `./cache` directory.

test locally.

### run requirements

pentium pro or greater processor

64MB of ram

windows 95 or 98

note OS must have winsock 2

on windows 95 might need to install ws2setup.exe

## build (web)

install and activate
[emscripten emsdk](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html#installation-instructions-using-the-emsdk-recommended).

    $ make -f Makefile.emscripten
    $ python3 -m http.server 1337 # @ http://localhost:1337/mudclient.html

host `mudclient.{html,data,js,wasm}` and `./cache/` directory.

## build (android)

[follow the pre-requisites listed on SDL's website](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/Android).

you should only need to run the following commands:

    export ANDROID_HOME="/usr/src/android-sdk-linux"
    export ANDROID_NDK_HOME="/usr/src/android-ndk-rXXx"
    cd org.scape2003.mudclient/
    ./gradlew assembleDebug

the APK will be located at `./app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`. you
can also use `./gradlew installDebug` to automatically build and install the APK
to a connected developer device.

tested with
[android-ndk-r24](https://github.com/android/ndk/wiki/Unsupported-Downloads).

## build (wii)

install
[wii-dev package in devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started),
and optionally [clone rgb-to-yuv2](https://github.com/misterhat/rgb-to-yuv2) to
re-build the \_yuv `.c` files in `./src/wii/` from the PNGs in `./wii`.

use [dolphin-emu](https://packages.debian.org/sid/dolphin-emu) to test
locally. enable LLE sound for sound-effects support. on real hardware you can
also use a USB keyboard and mouse.

see `./build-wii.sh` for building for Wii.

## build (3ds)

install
[3ds-dev package in devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started),
and optionally [bannertool](https://github.com/Steveice10/bannertool/) and
[makerom](https://github.com/3DSGuy/Project_CTR/tree/master/makerom) to build
an [installable `.cia` file](https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/CIA). use
[citra](https://citra-emu.org/download/) to test locally.

see `./build-3ds.sh` for building for 3DS.

## build (switch)

install
[switch-dev package in devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started),
switch-sdl2, and, switch-bzip2 to build
an [`.nro` file](https://switchbrew.org/wiki/NRO). use
[yuzu](https://yuzu-emu.org/) to test locally.

see `./build-switch.sh` for building for Switch.

## usage

arguments:
* `[members]`
    * pass any value other than "members" to load a free to play configuration
* `[ip address]`
    * an IPv4 address where the RSC177/204 compatible server is hosted
* `[port]`
    * network port number (e.g. 43594)
* `[RSA exponent]`
* `[RSA modulus]`
    * these two are used together to encrypt passwords, unique to each server.
    they must be converted to a hexadecimal representation
    [0-padded to a multiple of eight characters](https://github.com/kokke/tiny-bignum-c/issues/14)


for the desktop version, these are passed as command-line arguments. on the
web they're passed in the URL hash separated by commas
(`http://localhost:1337/mudclient.html#free,127.0.0.1`).
